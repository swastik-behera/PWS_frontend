                One Of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most
                of the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough
                on people. "Look at the results: he replied. VThese are all smart
                people I work witL and any of them could get a top job at
                another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they
                don't.' Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost
                wistfully. And we got some amazing things done." Indeed he
                and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years
                that was greater than that of any other innovative company in
                modern times; iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores,
                MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention
                every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
                surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre Of colleagues who had
                been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and
                four children.
