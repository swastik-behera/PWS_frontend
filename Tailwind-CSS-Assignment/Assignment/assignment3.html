            <span class="text-sm font-normal">
                writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded
                Apple in his parents' garage in 1976, ousted in 1985, returned to rescue from near bankruptcy in 1997,
                and by
                the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's nost valuable company. Along the he
                helped
                to Seven industries: personal Computing, aninated movies,
                phones, tablet retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of great
                innovators,
                along With Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Disney. None Of these a saint, but long after their
                personalities
                are forgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.
